This is a theme for LimeChat, based off of the DecafBland theme from Colloquy.

To install, simply copy (or symlink) the two files DecafBland.css and DecafBland.yaml
into ~/Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes/

The two files DecafBland-Inverted.{css,yaml} are for the Inverted variant.

## david leibovic's modifications to DecafBland.css:
* now up to 25 unique name colors ![limechat screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/s3xddcf.png)
* topic will be sticky once it has been changed (will not be sticky upon initially joining channel, unfortunately; however you can just do `/t` to get the topic if it has not yet become sticky) ![limechat screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/HhBZXPc.png)
